Click the Play! button to start the game. It will randomly decide who goes first. Click the game board boxes to mark your piece (X or O). An alert appears if you try to put your piece in a box already taken. If you get three boxes in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, an alert will say who won. If the game ends in a tie, an alert will pop up telling you it was a tie. To start a new game, just click Play! and the board will clear.
