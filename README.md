# Tic-Tac-Toe Project #1

### Welcome to Kelli's game of tic-tac-toe!

Click the Play! button to start the game. It will randomly decide who goes first. Click the game board boxes to mark your piece (X or O). An alert appears if you try to put your piece in a box already taken. If you get three boxes in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, an alert will say who won. If the game ends in a tie, an alert will pop up telling you it was a tie. To start a new game, just click Play! and the board will clear.

### What I used:

When you load the page, you'll find CSS animation of X's and O's crossing right to left in the header. I used Bootstrap to create the header as well as the panel holding the game instructions and the Play button which initiates the game. I changed the fonts for my title, paragraph text, button, and X and O's using Google Fonts. To create the game board, I just used html rows and columns!

Thanks for playing!
