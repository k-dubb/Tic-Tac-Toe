            <p>Players choose which game piece they'd like to have ("X" or "O"). Whoever is up first will put their mark in one of the nine boxes in the grid. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. You cannot put your mark on a square with a mark already in it.
            </p>
            <p>The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
            </p>
            <p>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. Cat's game!
            </p>
